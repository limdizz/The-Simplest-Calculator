# My-first-calculator-13.08.2022-
My first GitHub project ever. I've been making this one in the middle of my JavaScript learning when I learned variables, functions and loops.
It's written on Russian language, so Russian people can watch and test it.
Later English version of my calculator will be uploaded.

This calculator includes main math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, arithmetic root, exponentiation, sin, cos, tg, ctg.
You need to start HTML.html then calculator will be run. Enter your numbers in the box and get a result.
